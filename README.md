## Notes

Throughout the course of the project, I had to tackle a couple of obstacles. One of the major challenges I encountered was trying to figure out how to customize the navigation bar to display a black color instead of having a black tint. It took me quite some time to figure out the solution, but after several attempts, I finally got it to work.

Another hurdle that I had to overcome was finding out how to keep the navigation bar visible at all times. Initially, it only appeared when the user scrolled, which was not what I intended. It took some research and experimentation to find the right approach, but I eventually managed to make it work.

Lastly, I had to figure out how to make the second screen scrollable by incorporating a scrollView. This was a bit challenging because I had never done it before, but I was determined to figure it out. After some trial and error, I finally figured out the correct implementation, and it worked flawlessly.
