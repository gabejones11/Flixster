# Project 3 - *Flixster Part 2*

Submitted by: **Gabriel Jones**

**Flixster** has incorporated networking features with the help of the free TMDB API, enabling it to provide users with an updated list of movies currently playing in theaters. The API also offers accompanying details such as descriptions, vote ratings, vote counts, and popularity scores. Additionally, Flixster now offers a poster view feature, allowing users to browse the app by viewing movie posters instead of the traditional table view.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Implement network call and table view to display a list of movies currently playing (title, description, image)

- [x] Uses a tab bar controller to switch between collection view and table view screens
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes/Struggles

Adding and Styling the Tab Bar: One of the challenges that I faced during the development of this application was adding the tab bar and styling it to match with the navigation bar.

Formatting Cells in Collection View: Another difficulty that I encountered was formatting the cells in my collection view so that they looked good on any device and any screen orientation.

Incorporating Scroll View in Landscape Mode: Lastly, I struggled with incorporating the scroll view for when the device is in landscape mode on the detail view. This was particularly challenging as I had to ensure that the content remained visible and easily navigable despite the change in screen orientation.
